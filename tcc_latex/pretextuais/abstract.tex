This work presents a project focused on building a cloud architecture using Amazon Web Services (AWS), emphasizing scalability, security, and cost optimization. The proposal aims to demonstrate how cloud-based environments can offer more advantages than traditional on-premises infrastructures, particularly in terms of resource flexibility, deployment speed, and operational efficiency. However, it also highlights that, despite the many benefits of cloud computing, its success depends directly on the qualifications of the professionals responsible for its planning and implementation. A lack of technical expertise can compromise critical aspects such as security, availability, and cost control, potentially making the cloud less effective than a well-managed physical infrastructure. The project includes the design and automation of a three-layer architecture comprising load balancing, application, and database layers, implemented using VPC, public and private subnets, ECS Fargate, RDS MySQL, and S3, and provisioned through AWS CloudFormation. The results show that, when properly implemented, cloud computing proves to be a robust, replicable, and cost-effective alternative for organizations of different sizes.
